*I was just being informed by Github, that it is only possible to upload files not larger than 25 MB.  
As my project contains a larger Raster File (and I put some effort into integrating it to the project),  
I would kindly request you to download the file from the above standing link - to unzip it and to put the folder "Worldpop_Uganda100mPopulation" inside the folder "Data".*
